    "The return period is as the average time interval between the ocurrence of an event with a probability of exceedance $p_1$ in a period of one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of exceedance of the event in one year, $p_1$, for a return period $T_R$ is:\n",
    "$$p_1=\\frac{1}{T_R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the return period $T_R$ for an event with a probability of exceedance of $p_1$ in one year is:\n",
    "$$T_R=\\frac{1}{p_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to define the return period $T_R$ is the average time interval between the ocurrence of an event with a certain probability of exceedance $p_A$ in a certain period of time $T_A$. For a certain event defined by a probability of exceedance of $p_A$ in a certain period of time $n_A$, the return period $T_R$ is defined by:\n",
    "$$T_R=\\frac{1}{1-\\left(1-p_A\\right)^{1/T_A}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the probability of exceedance $p_A$ of a certain event in a period of time $T_A$, for a return period $T_R$ is given by:\n",
    "$$p_A=1-\\left(1-T_R\\right)^{T_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the probability of exceedance of the event in one year, $p_1$, for an event with a probability of excedence of $p_A$ in a period of $n_A$ is:\n",
    "$$p_1=\\frac{1}{T_R}=1-\\left(1-p_A \\right)^{1/n_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of exceedance, $p_R$, of an event with a probability of excedence of $p_A$ in a certain period of time $n_A$, during the return period $T_R$ is:\n",
    "$$p_R=1-\\left(1-p_A \\right)^{T_R/T_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that the probability of exceedance, $p_R$, of an event with a probability of excedence of $p_1$ in an one year period is:\n",
