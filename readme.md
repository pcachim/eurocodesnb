# EC2 Fire design of concrete structures

This series of notebooks present some calculation aids for calculating concrete structures under fire loading according to Eurocode 2 (EN 1992-1-2). For the moment there are worksheets for:

* correcting the distance according to critical temperature in tabulated data: [distance correction](ec-fire-tables.ipynb)
* calculating the distribution of temperature in a rrectangular cross section using siimplified rules: [temperature prrofiles](ec-fire-simplified-v2.ipynb)

Enjoy and give me feedback.
