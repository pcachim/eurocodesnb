# EurocodesNB

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks for the design of structures according to the Eurocodes. The notebooks cover various topics related to Eurocodes, including structural analysis, steel design, concrete design, timber design, and geotechnical design.

## Installation

To use these notebooks, you will need to have Python installed on your system along with several packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. We recommend using Anaconda, a popular Python distribution that comes with many pre-installed packages.

After installing Anaconda, you can create a new environment for EurocodesNB and install the required packages by running the following commands in your terminal:

conda create --name eurocodesnb python=3.8\
conda activate eurocodesnb\
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter


## Usage

To use the notebooks, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eurocodesnb.git


Then, navigate to the repository directory and launch Jupyter Notebook by running:

cd eurocodesnb \
jupyter notebook


This should open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter Notebook interface. From here, you can browse the notebooks and run them by clicking on the `.ipynb` files.
