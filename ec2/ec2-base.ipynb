    "EN 1992-1-1 describes the principles and requirements for safety, serviceability and durability of concrete structures, together with specific provisions for buildings. It is based on the limit state concept used in conjunction with a partial factor method. For the design of new structures, EN 1992-1-1 is intended to be used, for direct application, together with other parts of EN 1992, Eurocodes EN 1990, 1991, 1997 and 1998. \n",

It complies with the principles and requirements for the safety and serviceability of structures, the basis of their design and verification that are given in EN 1990: Basis of structural design. EC2 is only concerned with the requirements for resistance, serviceability, durability and fire resistance of concrete structures. Other requirements, e.g. concerning thermal or sound insulation, are not considered.\n",
